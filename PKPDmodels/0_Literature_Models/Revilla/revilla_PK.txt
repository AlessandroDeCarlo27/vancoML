DESCRIPTION:
The administration is via an infusion (requires INFUSION RATE or INFUSION DURATION column-type in the data set).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a linear elimination (clearance Cl).

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {V, Cl}

PK:
depot(target=Q)

EQUATION:
Cl2 = Cl*60/1000
t_0 = 0
Q_0 = 0
ddt_Q = (-Cl2/V)*Q

Cc = Q/V

OUTPUT:
output = Cc
